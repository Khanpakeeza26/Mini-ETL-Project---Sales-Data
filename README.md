# Mini ETL Project - Sales Data
Project Description: Sales Data ETL using Python and SQLite  This project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built using Python and SQLite. The goal of the project is to extract sales data from a CSV file, apply various data cleaning and transformation operations using pandas, and load the cleaned data into a SQLite database for further analysis.  The project focuses on the first two stages of a modern data engineering workflow:  Data Extraction and Loading: Reading structured sales data from a CSV file and loading it into an SQLite database (database.db).  Data Transformation: Cleaning and transforming the dataset by:  Calculating total sales (QUANTITYORDERED × PRICEEACH)  Converting order dates into a proper datetime format  Creating new attributes such as profit and deal size categories  Standardizing phone numbers into a consistent format using regular expressions  Handling missing or invalid data for better data quality  This project is ideal for beginners in data engineering who want hands-on experience building a lightweight ETL pipeline using Python’s data ecosystem.  Key Features  Uses pandas for data manipulation and transformation  Uses SQLite as the storage engine (lightweight and file-based)  Demonstrates best practices for data cleaning, type conversion, and data enrichment  Includes a phone number standardization transformation using regular expressions  Can be extended to include dimensional modeling and data warehousing  Tech Stack  Language: Python  Libraries: pandas, sqlite3, re  Database: SQLite  Dataset: Sales data (CSV format)  Future Enhancements  Implementing a data warehouse (warehouse.db) with dimensional modeling (Fact and Dimension tables)  Automating the ETL pipeline using Airflow or Prefect  Adding data validation and quality checks  Visualizing sales metrics using Power BI or Tableau
